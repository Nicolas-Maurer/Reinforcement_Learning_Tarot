# Tarot presentation. 

Tarot can be played from 3 to 5 players, but for this application, we will only focus on the 3-player version. 

## Deck 

The deck consists of 78 cards. The four suits are the standard ones of diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs, and each suit contains fourteen cards ranking from high to low:
King, Queen, Knight, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

In addition to the four standard suits there is a extra suit of twenty-one trumps numbered from 21 (high) to 1 (low).
Finally, there is a special card called the excuse, or the fool, marked with a star in the corner.

Three cards, the 1 of trump (called the petit), the 21 of trump and the excuse are particularly important in the game and are known as bouts ("ends") or sometimes in books as oudlers.
Not only are the bouts worth points, but having them in your tricks also reduces the total number of points you need to win.
